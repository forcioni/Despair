# Despair
text-based game developed with python
This terminal game will be a text-based horror game.
The first step is to think about the functionality, the text and situations
featured in it must be compatible with the available functionality.
There is a horror questionnaire game, this might be a starting point.
How about a basic MBIT test followed by questions tailored to disturb the
user based on their personality type? Sounds interesting.
A common theme of such types of games is hinting at the program being
self-aware in some manner, a question is whether this has become
overused and mundane.
Either way, the basic functionality is as simple as can be: a sequence
of multiple-choice questions interspersed with commentary about the
player based on their MBIT personality type.
